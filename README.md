Marcela and I are friends since we were in high school. We both took similar paths and spent several years working in advertising. 
She knew how she wants to present her work, so she gave me a draft which I used as a reference. 

For this course, we decided to try to sell some of her illustrations within Europe. 

Users that will be buying her work are her followers and people looking for unique pieces made by her.
